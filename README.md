# server

Empty Express server used as a starting point for demos

## Configure Environment

- add a `.env` file next to `index.js` to configure environment variables. To configure the port to use when running on localhost add the following constant to the `.env` file:

```bash
PORT=3300
```

## Running the Server

To have the server automatically restart on changes to the code, run it using `npm run server` or `yarn server`.

Typing `npm start` or `yarn start` runs the server, but will not automatically restart it when files change.
